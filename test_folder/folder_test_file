Scenario2:
Problem statement :
Created 5 files locally and pushed to repository.
In repository (github) you have created 1 folder (kodanda)
Now you have created a file locally and trying to push(by using add commit push), 
you will get error as Your code is not up to date

Solution :
git pull
after pull, your code will be up to date.
Then you can apply add, commit, push commands
====================================================================
Scenario3:
Problem Statement:
If you face problem in typing wrong URL everytime
Solution:

You can give alias name (origin) for your URL by using below command
 git remote add origin https://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@github.com/sasi0611/PNB.git

After setting alias name origin you can use origin instead of URL
 git add .
 git commit -m "created"
 git push origin branch_name
=====================================================================

Directly you can make changes in github.com also
 
For updating local directory :
git pull (or) git pull origin main
